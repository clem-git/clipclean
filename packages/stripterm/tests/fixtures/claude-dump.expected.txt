Here is a response from Claude that has been wrapped across multiple lines because the terminal window was too narrow.

• First bullet point with some extra text that wraps
• Second bullet point

1. Numbered item one that also wraps to next line
2. Numbered item two

This is a paragraph that continues on the next line with lowercase text that should be joined.

Another paragraph starts here with an Uppercase letter.
